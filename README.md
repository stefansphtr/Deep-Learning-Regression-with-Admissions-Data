# BUILD DEEP LEARNING REGRESSION MODELS WITH TENSORFLOW
---

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).

## Project Description

By analyzing the parameters in this graduate admissions dataset, I will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted. This will give further insight into the graduate admissions world and improve test prep strategy.
